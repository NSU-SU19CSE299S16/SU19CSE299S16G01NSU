**Problem Statement**

Bangladesh is a developing country; it is also a country of middle income. But as we are developing we need to pay attention to our people’s health issues. Many people of Bangladesh do not have the common idea about how to lead a healthy life and maintain their health and this is a big problem for our country as because of awareness we often get sick by various diseases, we cannot create awareness to the whole country at a time, we need to create awareness place by place gradually, so people can understand the important of being healthy and they can maintain a healthy life. And to solve this problem we have come up with a solution to create a blogging website where all kind of health related post will be approved and people can ask any health related questions in that platform, we wanted to combine a specific university peoples into a unique platform that’s why we want to create this blogging website so that people of this community can have a better understanding about their health.





**INTRODUCTION**

Healthy NSU is a blogging site which is created with a purpose to build a strong awareness about health problems for this university. This is a website where both students and teachers can ask health related problem without any hesitation, or they can also suggest any solution to a health related problem. As day by day the number of patients in our country is increasing so we want to limit this number as few as we can. Healthy NSU will be able to help students and teachers to maintain a healthy life and will get them safe from any health related issues. None the less, this website will only be available to the students of North South University so a clear communication between the university people will be created by this platform.

**Methodology**

As this is a web based project, I have selected a frame work for the backend development, and for frontend I have used bootstrap and JavaScript. 

  - Frontend: - JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap
  - Backend: - Django

I have worked in an incremental development way where I will specifically work on different issues on every week and solve those issues and developed the website step by step, to track those issues I have used a board on GitHub where I can address every issues I work on and move them from to-do to doing and done. Every time I started solving an issue I moved and card from to-do to doing, and when I am done solving the issue I moved that card to done and closed that issue.

To track my codes and to make much efficient code I have used a version control tool called GitHub. Where I created a repository and I constantly worked on that repository committed my codes there and whenever I needed to check my codes I can efficiently check those code on GitHub. On every issues a branch has been created and for that particular issue that branch has been used. Whenever that issue has been closed the branch has been merged with the master branch and that branch has been deleted.

This was a single person project but to keep communication with Groupmate I have used slack where I have been assigned a secret channel and on that channel I constantly gave update about my project development twice a week.
