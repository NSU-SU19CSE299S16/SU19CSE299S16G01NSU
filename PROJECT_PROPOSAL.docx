Introduction :
Healthy NSU is a blogging site which is created with a purpose to build a strong awareness about health problems for this university.
This is a website where both students and teachers can ask health related problem without any hesitation, or they can also suggest any
solution to a health related problem. As day by day the number of patients in our country is increasing so we want to limit this number
as few as we can.  Healthy NSU will be able to help students and teachers to maintain a healthy life and will get them safe from any health
related issues.  None the less, this website will only be available to the students of North South University so a clear communication between
the university people will be created by this platform.

Problem statement:
Bangladesh is a developing country; it is also a country of middle income. But as we are developing we need to pay attention to our people’s health
issues.  Many people of Bangladesh do not have the common idea about how to lead a healthy life and maintain their health and this is a big problem
for our country as because of awareness we often get sick by various diseases, we cannot create awareness to the whole country at a time, we need
to create awareness place by place gradually, so people can understand the important of being healthy and they can maintain a healthy life. And to
solve this problem we have come up with a solution to create a blogging website where all kind of health related post will be approved and people can
 ask any health related questions in that platform, we wanted to combine a specific university peoples into a unique platform that’s why we want to
 create this blogging website so that people of this community can have a better understanding about their health.

 Type of platform:
 For this project we want to create a web based app where people can log into that app and use that web app as their need.

 Framework:
 We will use Django framework to develop this project.

 Features:
These features will be available on the webapp:
	Special kind authentication
	Two kind of users
	Health related post menu
	Q/A related post menu
	Nearest hospitals list

Future business plan:
In future we want to develop this app with some more features. We will add some verified doctors to our webapp who will be available 24/7 to
answer any kind of health related issues or can help with any emergency situation instantly. We will also add a feature like online appointment,
 where users can set their appointment with doctors via online. We will an option like anonymous post, where  premium users can post about their
  problems anonymously without any hesitation. But to use these feature we will cost them in a yearly basis like 300/= TAKA per year. 

We will also add online medicine shopping option where they can buy some common medicines (which do not need prescription to buy) from our webapp.
