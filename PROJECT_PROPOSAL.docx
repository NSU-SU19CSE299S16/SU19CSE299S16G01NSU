Introduction :
Healthy NSU is a blogging site which is created with a purpose to build a strong awareness about health problems for this university.
This is a website where both students and teachers can ask health related problem without any hesitation, or they can also suggest any
solution to a health related problem. As day by day the number of patients in our country is increasing so we want to limit this number
as few as we can.  Healthy NSU will be able to help students and teachers to maintain a healthy life and will get them safe from any health
related issues.  None the less, this website will only be available to the students of North South University so a clear communication between
the university people will be created by this platform.
